      "Feta (Greek: φέτα, féta) is a Greek brined white cheese made from sheep's
      milk or from a mixture of sheep and goat's milk. It is soft, with small or
      no holes, a compact touch, few cuts, and no skin. Crumbly with a slightly
      grainy texture, it is formed into large blocks and aged in brine."
